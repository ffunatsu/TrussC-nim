    sokol_app_tc.h -- TrussC's application layer: the sokol_app.h API,
    implemented standalone, plus native multi-window support

    Project URL: https://github.com/TrussC-org/TrussC
    Fork lineage: sokol_app.h by Andre Weissflog (https://github.com/floooh/sokol)
    License: zlib/libpng (same as sokol_app.h, see end of file)

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_APP_TC_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C++/Objective-C++ source file to
    create the implementation. The header is SELF-CONTAINED: it carries the
    complete sokol_app.h public interface (absorbed verbatim below -- types,
    enums, sapp_* declarations and the original documentation) and implements
    it on every TrussC platform. The upstream sokol_app.h file does not exist
    in this tree anymore.

    WHAT IT IS
    ==========
    The full sapp_* application layer (sapp_run, events, clipboard, dnd,
    cursors, fullscreen, ...) plus native multi-window support with
    per-window vsync ticks on the desktop platforms: the "main window" is
    simply window #0, created from the sapp_desc, and the app's OS run loop
    is owned here. The implementation TU looks like:

        #define SOKOL_IMPL
        #include "sokol_log.h"
        #define SOKOL_APP_TC_IMPL
        #include "sokol_app_tc.h"     // declarations + implementation
        #include "sokol_gfx.h"
        ...

    The single-window API behaves like sokol_app.h's native backends (the
    cancellable quit dance, RGB10A2 default color format, clipboard,
    drag&drop, cursor control, fullscreen; macOS: lazy drawable acquisition
    in sapp_get_swapchain(); Windows: skip_present honored on Present,
    per-monitor-v2 DPI), with one deliberate deviation: calling
    sapp_dpi_scale() before sapp_run() returns the OS display scale
    instead of 0.

    What replaces sokol_app.h's Windows render loop is the same per-window
    tick idea: instead of the upstream PeekMessage busy-render-loop (and
    instead of a ~64Hz WM_TIMER), every window's DXGI swapchain is created
    with DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_FRAME_LATENCY_WAITABLE_OBJECT and the message
    loop blocks in MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx on the per-window frame
    latency waitable objects: each window ticks when ITS swapchain can
    accept a frame (true vsync pacing per display), and the loop sleeps
    otherwise. A tick that ends without a Present (skip_present, occluded,
    minimized) holds its waitable "credit" and is re-paced by a timer until
    the next real Present, so neither busy-spinning nor waitable starvation
    can occur.

    The multi-window API shape follows floooh's multi-window sketch (sokol
    PR #437 / issue #229): a small `sapp_window` handle, a `sapp_window_desc`,
    and window-parameterized query functions. What is NEW compared to #437 is
    the frame model, and it is the load-bearing idea:

      - There is no shared frame loop that iterates windows. Each window has
        its OWN vsync source (macOS: one CADisplayLink per window, delivered
        on the main run loop) which invokes the window's `tick_cb`.
      - A fully occluded window's display link suspends, and an explicit
        occlusion gate guards drawable acquisition. The `[CAMetalLayer
        nextDrawable]` ~1s stall that killed PR #437 cannot occur, because
        the acquiring code path is only ever entered for a visible window.
        An occluded window simply stops ticking (fps 0) and resumes on
        un-occlusion; SAPP_EVENTTYPE_SUSPENDED / _RESUMED are sent at the
        transitions.
      - Windows on displays with different refresh rates each tick at their
        own display's rate. Tick coalescing is depth-1 per window by
        construction (the run loop is the queue and a display link never
        stacks callbacks).

    Rendering: all windows share the one sokol_gfx context (post-2024
    sokol_gfx takes the swapchain per-pass). During `tick_cb`, acquire this
    window's swapchain handles via sapp_window_metal_current_drawable() /
    ..._depth_stencil_texture() / ..._msaa_color_texture() and start a pass
    with them. The drawable is acquired lazily right before tick_cb and is
    valid only for that callback.

    Events: delivered as plain sapp_event through the desc's `event_cb`,
    with the owning window passed alongside (sapp_event itself has no window
    field while we coexist with upstream sokol_app.h). Keyboard uses the
    same keycode translation table as sokol_app.h, so SAPP_KEYCODE_* values
    are identical across the main window and secondary windows.

    Coordinates follow sokol_app.h conventions: mouse positions arrive in
    framebuffer pixels (divide by sapp_window_dpi_scale() for logical
    points). dpi_scale is derived from ONE source (the ratio actually used
    to size the layer's drawable), never assumed to be 2.

    Everything runs on the main thread. All functions must be called from
    the main thread.

    PLATFORM SUPPORT
    ================
    macOS: implemented (NSWindow + CAMetalLayer + CADisplayLink, macOS 14+).
    Windows: implemented (HWND + D3D11 + DXGI flip swapchain, one frame
    latency waitable object per window; Windows 10+).
    Linux: implemented (X11 + GLX, one shared GL context with a GLXWindow
    drawable per window; main window paced by its blocking vsync'd
    glXSwapBuffers, secondary windows swap interval 0 + timer-paced).
    Web: implemented, single-window (one <canvas>, rAF frame loop, WebGPU or
    WebGL2; sapp_create_window() returns the invalid handle -- a second
    window is not representable in a browser tab).
    iOS: implemented, single-window (UIApplicationMain + UIWindowScene +
    CAMetalLayer + CADisplayLink, Metal only; sapp_create_window() returns
    the invalid handle -- one UIWindow per scene).
    Others (Android): stubs that return an invalid handle (explicit
    platform gap).

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_APP_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    In the same place define one of the following to select the 3D-API
    which should be initialized by sokol_app.h (this must also match
    the backend selected for sokol_gfx.h if both are used in the same
    project):

        #define SOKOL_GLCORE
        #define SOKOL_GLES3
        #define SOKOL_D3D11
        #define SOKOL_METAL
        #define SOKOL_WGPU
        #define SOKOL_VULKAN
        #define SOKOL_NOAPI

    Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:

        SOKOL_ASSERT(c)             - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
        SOKOL_UNREACHABLE()         - a guard macro for unreachable code (default: assert(false))
        SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_MAIN      - define this on Win32 to add a main() entry point
        SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_WINMAIN   - define this on Win32 to add a WinMain() entry point (enabled by default unless
                                      SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_MAIN or SOKOL_NO_ENTRY is defined)
        SOKOL_NO_ENTRY              - define this if sokol_app.h shouldn't "hijack" the main() function
        SOKOL_APP_API_DECL          - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
        SOKOL_API_DECL              - same as SOKOL_APP_API_DECL
        SOKOL_API_IMPL              - public function implementation prefix (default: -)

    Optionally define the following to force debug checks and validations
    even in release mode:

        SOKOL_DEBUG         - by default this is defined if NDEBUG is not defined

    If sokol_app.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

        SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_APP_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    if SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_MAIN and SOKOL_WIN32_FORCE_WINMAIN are both defined,
    it is up to the developer to define the desired subsystem.

    On Linux, SOKOL_GLCORE can use either GLX or EGL.
    GLX is default, set SOKOL_FORCE_EGL to override.

    For example code, see https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples/tree/master/sapp

    Portions of the Windows and Linux GL initialization, event-, icon- etc... code
    have been taken from GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/).

    iOS onscreen keyboard support 'inspired' by libgdx.

    On macOS and iOS, the implementation must be compiled as Objective-C.

    On Emscripten:
        - for WebGL2: add the linker option `-s USE_WEBGL2=1`
        - for WebGPU: compile and link with `--use-port=emdawnwebgpu`
          (for more exotic situations read: https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/src/emdawnwebgpu/pkg/README.md)

    STEP BY STEP
    ============
    --- Add a sokol_main() function to your code which returns a sapp_desc structure
        with initialization parameters and callback function pointers. This
        function is called very early, usually at the start of the
        platform's entry function (e.g. main or WinMain). You should do as
        little as possible here, since the rest of your code might be called
        from another thread (this depends on the platform):

            sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
                return (sapp_desc) {
                    .width = 640,
                    .height = 480,
                    .init_cb = my_init_func,
                    .frame_cb = my_frame_func,
                    .cleanup_cb = my_cleanup_func,
                    .event_cb = my_event_func,
                    ...
                };
            }

        To get any logging output in case of errors you need to provide a log
        callback. The easiest way is via sokol_log.h:

            #include "sokol_log.h"

            sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
                return (sapp_desc) {
                    ...
                    .logger.func = slog_func,
                };
            }

        There are many more setup parameters, but these are the most important.
        For a complete list search for the sapp_desc structure declaration
        below.

        DO NOT call any sokol-app function from inside sokol_main(), since
        sokol-app will not be initialized at this point.

        The .width and .height parameters are the preferred size of the 3D
        rendering canvas. The actual size may differ from this depending on
        platform and other circumstances. Also the canvas size may change at
        any time (for instance when the user resizes the application window,
        or rotates the mobile device). You can just keep .width and .height
        zero-initialized to open a default-sized window (what "default-size"
        exactly means is platform-specific, but usually it's a size that covers
        most of, but not all, of the display).

        All provided function callbacks will be called from the same thread,
        but this may be different from the thread where sokol_main() was called.

        .init_cb (void (*)(void))
            This function is called once after the application window,
            3D rendering context and swap chain have been created. The
            function takes no arguments and has no return value.
        .frame_cb (void (*)(void))
            This is the per-frame callback, which is usually called 60
            times per second. This is where your application would update
            most of its state and perform all rendering.
        .cleanup_cb (void (*)(void))
            The cleanup callback is called once right before the application
            quits.
        .event_cb (void (*)(const sapp_event* event))
            The event callback is mainly for input handling, but is also
            used to communicate other types of events to the application. Keep the
            event_cb struct member zero-initialized if your application doesn't require
            event handling.

        As you can see, those 'standard callbacks' don't have a user_data
        argument, so any data that needs to be preserved between callbacks
        must live in global variables. If keeping state in global variables
        is not an option, there's an alternative set of callbacks with
        an additional user_data pointer argument:

        .user_data (void*)
            The user-data argument for the callbacks below
        .init_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .frame_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .cleanup_userdata_cb (void (*)(void* user_data))
        .event_userdata_cb (void(*)(const sapp_event* event, void* user_data))

        The function sapp_userdata() can be used to query the user_data
        pointer provided in the sapp_desc struct.

        You can also call sapp_query_desc() to get a copy of the
        original sapp_desc structure.

        NOTE that there's also an alternative compile mode where sokol_app.h
        doesn't "hijack" the main() function. Search below for SOKOL_NO_ENTRY.

    --- Implement the initialization callback function (init_cb), this is called
        once after the rendering surface, 3D API and swap chain have been
        initialized by sokol_app. All sokol-app functions can be called
        from inside the initialization callback, the most useful functions
        at this point are:

        int sapp_width(void)
        int sapp_height(void)
            Returns the current width and height of the default framebuffer in pixels,
            this may change from one frame to the next, and it may be different
            from the initial size provided in the sapp_desc struct.

        float sapp_widthf(void)
        float sapp_heightf(void)
            These are alternatives to sapp_width() and sapp_height() which return
            the default framebuffer size as float values instead of integer. This
            may help to prevent casting back and forth between int and float
            in more strongly typed languages than C and C++.

        double sapp_frame_duration(void)
            Returns a smoothed frame duration.

        double sapp_frame_duration_unfiltered(void)
            Returns the unfiltered frame duration with varying degree of
            jitter (depending on platform and backend).

        int sapp_color_format(void)
        int sapp_depth_format(void)
            The color and depth-stencil pixelformats of the default framebuffer,
            as integer values which are compatible with sokol-gfx's
            sg_pixel_format enum (so that they can be plugged directly in places
            where sg_pixel_format is expected). Possible values are:

                23 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8
                28 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_BGRA8
                42 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH
                43 == SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTH_STENCIL

        int sapp_sample_count(void)
            Return the MSAA sample count of the default framebuffer.

        const void* sapp_metal_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_metal_get_current_drawable(void)
        const void* sapp_metal_get_depth_stencil_texture(void)
        const void* sapp_metal_get_msaa_color_texture(void)
            If the Metal backend has been selected, these functions return pointers
            to various Metal API objects required for rendering, otherwise
            they return a null pointer. These void pointers are actually
            Objective-C ids converted with a (ARC) __bridge cast so that
            the ids can be tunneled through C code. Also note that the returned
            pointers may change from one frame to the next, only the Metal device
            object is guaranteed to stay the same.

        const void* sapp_macos_get_window(void)
            On macOS, get the NSWindow object pointer, otherwise a null pointer.
            Before being used as Objective-C object, the void* must be converted
            back with a (ARC) __bridge cast.

        const void* sapp_ios_get_window(void)
            On iOS, get the UIWindow object pointer, otherwise a null pointer.
            Before being used as Objective-C object, the void* must be converted
            back with a (ARC) __bridge cast.

        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_device_context(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_render_view(void)
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_resolve_view(void);
        const void* sapp_d3d11_get_depth_stencil_view(void)
            Similar to the sapp_metal_* functions, the sapp_d3d11_* functions
            return pointers to D3D11 API objects required for rendering,
            only if the D3D11 backend has been selected. Otherwise they
            return a null pointer. Note that the returned pointers to the
            render-target-view and depth-stencil-view may change from one
            frame to the next!

        const void* sapp_win32_get_hwnd(void)
            On Windows, get the window's HWND, otherwise a null pointer. The
            HWND has been cast to a void pointer in order to be tunneled
            through code which doesn't include Windows.h.

        const void* sapp_x11_get_window(void)
            On Linux, get the X11 Window, otherwise a null pointer. The
            Window has been cast to a void pointer in order to be tunneled
            through code which doesn't include X11/Xlib.h.

        const void* sapp_x11_get_display(void)
            On Linux, get the X11 Display, otherwise a null pointer. The
            Display has been cast to a void pointer in order to be tunneled
            through code which doesn't include X11/Xlib.h.

        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_device(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_render_view(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_resolve_view(void)
        const void* sapp_wgpu_get_depth_stencil_view(void)
            These are the WebGPU-specific functions to get the WebGPU
            objects and values required for rendering. If sokol_app.h
            is not compiled with SOKOL_WGPU, these functions return null.

        uint32_t sapp_gl_get_framebuffer(void)
            This returns the 'default framebuffer' of the GL context.
            Typically this will be zero.

        int sapp_gl_get_major_version(void)
        int sapp_gl_get_minor_version(void)
        bool sapp_gl_is_gles(void)
            Returns the major and minor version of the GL context and
            whether the GL context is a GLES context

        const void* sapp_android_get_native_activity(void);
            On Android, get the native activity ANativeActivity pointer, otherwise
            a null pointer.

    --- Implement the frame-callback function, this function will be called
        on the same thread as the init callback, but might be on a different
        thread than the sokol_main() function. Note that the size of
        the rendering framebuffer might have changed since the frame callback
        was called last. Call the functions sapp_width() and sapp_height()
        each frame to get the current size.

    --- Optionally implement the event-callback to handle input events.
        sokol-app provides the following type of input events:
            - a 'virtual key' was pressed down or released
            - a single text character was entered (provided as UTF-32 encoded
              UNICODE code point)
            - a mouse button was pressed down or released (left, right, middle)
            - mouse-wheel or 2D scrolling events
            - the mouse was moved
            - the mouse has entered or left the application window boundaries
            - low-level, portable multi-touch events (began, moved, ended, cancelled)
            - the application window was resized, iconified or restored
            - the application was suspended or restored (on mobile platforms)
            - the user or application code has asked to quit the application
            - a string was pasted to the system clipboard
            - one or more files have been dropped onto the application window

        To explicitly 'consume' an event and prevent that the event is
        forwarded for further handling to the operating system, call
        sapp_consume_event() from inside the event handler (NOTE that
        this behaviour is currently only implemented for some HTML5
        events, support for other platforms and event types will
        be added as needed, please open a GitHub ticket and/or provide
        a PR if needed).

        NOTE: Do *not* call any 3D API rendering functions in the event
        callback function, since the 3D API context may not be active when the
        event callback is called (it may work on some platforms and 3D APIs,
        but not others, and the exact behaviour may change between
        sokol-app versions).

    --- Implement the cleanup-callback function, this is called once
        after the user quits the application (see the section
        "APPLICATION QUIT" for detailed information on quitting
        behaviour, and how to intercept a pending quit - for instance to show a
        "Really Quit?" dialog box). Note that the cleanup-callback isn't
        guaranteed to be called on the web and mobile platforms.

    MOUSE CURSOR TYPE AND VISIBILITY
    ================================
    You can show and hide the mouse cursor with

        void sapp_show_mouse(bool show)

    And to get the current shown status:

        bool sapp_mouse_shown(void)

    NOTE that hiding the mouse cursor is different and independent from
    the MOUSE/POINTER LOCK feature which will also hide the mouse pointer when
    active (MOUSE LOCK is described below).

    To change the mouse cursor to one of several predefined types, call
    the function:

        void sapp_set_mouse_cursor(sapp_mouse_cursor cursor)

    Setting the default mouse cursor SAPP_MOUSECURSOR_DEFAULT will restore
    the standard look.

    To get the currently active mouse cursor type, call:

        sapp_mouse_cursor sapp_get_mouse_cursor(void)

    MOUSE LOCK (AKA POINTER LOCK, AKA MOUSE CAPTURE)
    ================================================
    In normal mouse mode, no mouse movement events are reported when the
    mouse leaves the windows client area or hits the screen border (whether
    it's one or the other depends on the platform), and the mouse move events
    (SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_MOVE) contain absolute mouse positions in
    framebuffer pixels in the sapp_event items mouse_x and mouse_y, and
    relative movement in framebuffer pixels in the sapp_event items mouse_dx
    and mouse_dy.

    To get continuous mouse movement (also when the mouse leaves the window
    client area or hits the screen border), activate mouse-lock mode
    by calling:

        sapp_lock_mouse(true)

    When mouse lock is activated, the mouse pointer is hidden, the
    reported absolute mouse position (sapp_event.mouse_x/y) appears
    frozen, and the relative mouse movement in sapp_event.mouse_dx/dy
    no longer has a direct relation to framebuffer pixels but instead
    uses "raw mouse input" (what "raw mouse input" exactly means also
    differs by platform).

    To deactivate mouse lock and return to normal mouse mode, call

        sapp_lock_mouse(false)

    And finally, to check if mouse lock is currently active, call

        if (sapp_mouse_locked()) { ... }

    Note that mouse-lock state may not change immediately after sapp_lock_mouse(true/false)
    is called, instead on some platforms the actual state switch may be delayed
    to the end of the current frame or even to a later frame.

    The mouse may also be unlocked automatically without calling sapp_lock_mouse(false),
    most notably when the application window becomes inactive.

    On the web platform there are further restrictions to be aware of, caused
    by the limitations of the HTML5 Pointer Lock API:

        - sapp_lock_mouse(true) can be called at any time, but it will
          only take effect in a 'short-lived input event handler of a specific
          type', meaning when one of the following events happens:
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_DOWN
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_UP
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_SCROLL
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_KEY_UP
            - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_KEY_DOWN
        - The mouse lock/unlock action on the web platform is asynchronous,
          this means that sapp_mouse_locked() won't immediately return
          the new status after calling sapp_lock_mouse(), instead the
          reported status will only change when the pointer lock has actually
          been activated or deactivated in the browser.
        - On the web, mouse lock can be deactivated by the user at any time
          by pressing the Esc key. When this happens, sokol_app.h behaves
          the same as if sapp_lock_mouse(false) is called.

    For things like camera manipulation it's most straightforward to lock
    and unlock the mouse right from the sokol_app.h event handler, for
    instance the following code enters and leaves mouse lock when the
    left mouse button is pressed and released, and then uses the relative
    movement information to manipulate a camera (taken from the
    cgltf-sapp.c sample in the sokol-samples repository
    at https://github.com/floooh/sokol-samples):

        static void input(const sapp_event* ev) {
            switch (ev->type) {
                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_DOWN:
                    if (ev->mouse_button == SAPP_MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) {
                        sapp_lock_mouse(true);
                    }
                    break;

                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_UP:
                    if (ev->mouse_button == SAPP_MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) {
                        sapp_lock_mouse(false);
                    }
                    break;

                case SAPP_EVENTTYPE_MOUSE_MOVE:
                    if (sapp_mouse_locked()) {
                        cam_orbit(&state.camera, ev->mouse_dx * 0.25f, ev->mouse_dy * 0.25f);
                    }
                    break;

                default:
                    break;
            }
        }

    For a 'first person shooter mouse' the following code inside the sokol-app event handler
    is recommended somewhere in your frame callback:

        if (!sapp_mouse_locked()) {
            sapp_lock_mouse(true);
        }

    CLIPBOARD SUPPORT
    =================
    Applications can send and receive UTF-8 encoded text data from and to the
    system clipboard. By default, clipboard support is disabled and
    must be enabled at startup via the following sapp_desc struct
    members:

        sapp_desc.enable_clipboard  - set to true to enable clipboard support
        sapp_desc.clipboard_size    - size of the internal clipboard buffer in bytes

    Enabling the clipboard will dynamically allocate a clipboard buffer
    for UTF-8 encoded text data of the requested size in bytes, the default
    size is 8 KBytes. Strings that don't fit into the clipboard buffer
    (including the terminating zero) will be silently clipped, so it's
    important that you provide a big enough clipboard size for your
    use case.

    To send data to the clipboard, call sapp_set_clipboard_string() with
    a pointer to an UTF-8 encoded, null-terminated C-string.

    NOTE that on the HTML5 platform, sapp_set_clipboard_string() must be
    called from inside a 'short-lived event handler', and there are a few
    other HTML5-specific caveats to workaround. You'll basically have to
    tinker until it works in all browsers :/ (maybe the situation will
    improve when all browsers agree on and implement the new
    HTML5 navigator.clipboard API).

    To get data from the clipboard, check for the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED
    event in your event handler function, and then call sapp_get_clipboard_string()
    to obtain the pasted UTF-8 encoded text.

    NOTE that behaviour of sapp_get_clipboard_string() is slightly different
    depending on platform:

        - on the HTML5 platform, the internal clipboard buffer will only be updated
          right before the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event is sent,
          and sapp_get_clipboard_string() will simply return the current content
          of the clipboard buffer
        - on 'native' platforms, the call to sapp_get_clipboard_string() will
          update the internal clipboard buffer with the most recent data
          from the system clipboard

    Portable code should check for the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event,
    and then call sapp_get_clipboard_string() right in the event handler.

    The SAPP_EVENTTYPE_CLIPBOARD_PASTED event will be generated by sokol-app
    as follows:

        - on macOS: when the Cmd+V key is pressed down
        - on HTML5: when the browser sends a 'paste' event to the global 'window' object
        - on all other platforms: when the Ctrl+V key is pressed down

    DRAG AND DROP SUPPORT
    =====================
    PLEASE NOTE: the drag'n'drop feature works differently on WASM/HTML5
    and on the native desktop platforms (Win32, Linux and macOS) because
    of security-related restrictions in the HTML5 drag'n'drop API. The
    WASM/HTML5 specifics are described at the end of this documentation
    section:

    Like clipboard support, drag'n'drop support must be explicitly enabled
    at startup in the sapp_desc struct.

        sapp_desc sokol_main(void) {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                .enable_dragndrop = true,   // default is false
                ...
            };
        }

    You can also adjust the maximum number of files that are accepted
    in a drop operation, and the maximum path length in bytes if needed:

        sapp_desc sokol_main(void) {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                .enable_dragndrop = true,               // default is false
                .max_dropped_files = 8,                 // default is 1
                .max_dropped_file_path_length = 8192,   // in bytes, default is 2048
                ...
            };
        }

    When drag'n'drop is enabled, the event callback will be invoked with an
    event of type SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED whenever the user drops files on
    the application window.

    After the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED is received, you can query the
    number of dropped files, and their absolute paths by calling separate
    functions:

        void on_event(const sapp_event* ev) {
            if (ev->type == SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED) {

                // the mouse position where the drop happened
                float x = ev->mouse_x;
                float y = ev->mouse_y;

                // get the number of files and their paths like this:
                const int num_dropped_files = sapp_get_num_dropped_files();
                for (int i = 0; i < num_dropped_files; i++) {
                    const char* path = sapp_get_dropped_file_path(i);
                    ...
                }
            }
        }

    The returned file paths are UTF-8 encoded strings.

    You can call sapp_get_num_dropped_files() and sapp_get_dropped_file_path()
    anywhere, also outside the event handler callback, but be aware that the
    file path strings will be overwritten with the next drop operation.

    In any case, sapp_get_dropped_file_path() will never return a null pointer,
    instead an empty string "" will be returned if the drag'n'drop feature
    hasn't been enabled, the last drop-operation failed, or the file path index
    is out of range.

    Drag'n'drop caveats:

        - if more files are dropped in a single drop-action
          than sapp_desc.max_dropped_files, the additional
          files will be silently ignored
        - if any of the file paths is longer than
          sapp_desc.max_dropped_file_path_length (in number of bytes, after UTF-8
          encoding) the entire drop operation will be silently ignored (this
          needs some sort of error feedback in the future)
        - no mouse positions are reported while the drag is in
          process, this may change in the future

    Drag'n'drop on HTML5/WASM:

    The HTML5 drag'n'drop API doesn't return file paths, but instead
    black-box 'file objects' which must be used to load the content
    of dropped files. This is the reason why sokol_app.h adds two
    HTML5-specific functions to the drag'n'drop API:

        uint32_t sapp_html5_get_dropped_file_size(int index)
            Returns the size in bytes of a dropped file.

        void sapp_html5_fetch_dropped_file(const sapp_html5_fetch_request* request)
            Asynchronously loads the content of a dropped file into a
            provided memory buffer (which must be big enough to hold
            the file content)

    To start loading the first dropped file after an SAPP_EVENTTYPE_FILES_DROPPED
    event is received:

        sapp_html5_fetch_dropped_file(&(sapp_html5_fetch_request){
            .dropped_file_index = 0,
            .callback = fetch_cb
            .buffer = {
                .ptr = buf,
                .size = sizeof(buf)
            },
            .user_data = ...
        });

    Make sure that the memory pointed to by 'buf' stays valid until the
    callback function is called!

    As result of the asynchronous loading operation (no matter if succeeded or
    failed) the 'fetch_cb' function will be called:

        void fetch_cb(const sapp_html5_fetch_response* response) {
            // IMPORTANT: check if the loading operation actually succeeded:
            if (response->succeeded) {
                // the size of the loaded file:
                const size_t num_bytes = response->data.size;
                // and the pointer to the data (same as 'buf' in the fetch-call):
                const void* ptr = response->data.ptr;
            } else {
                // on error check the error code:
                switch (response->error_code) {
                    case SAPP_HTML5_FETCH_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL:
                        ...
                        break;
                    case SAPP_HTML5_FETCH_ERROR_OTHER:
                        ...
                        break;
                }
            }
        }

    HIGH-DPI RENDERING
    ==================
    You can set the sapp_desc.high_dpi flag during initialization to request
    a full-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays. The default behaviour
    is sapp_desc.high_dpi=false, this means that the application will
    render to a lower-resolution framebuffer on HighDPI displays and the
    rendered content will be upscaled by the window system composer.

    In a HighDPI scenario, you still request the same window size during
    sokol_main(), but the framebuffer sizes returned by sapp_width()
    and sapp_height() will be scaled up according to the DPI scaling
    ratio.

    Note that on some platforms the DPI scaling factor may change at any
    time (for instance when a window is moved from a high-dpi display
    to a low-dpi display).

    To query the current DPI scaling factor, call the function:

    float sapp_dpi_scale(void);

    For instance on a Retina Mac, returning the following sapp_desc
    struct from sokol_main():

    sapp_desc sokol_main(void) {
        return (sapp_desc) {
            .width = 640,
            .height = 480,
            .high_dpi = true,
            ...
        };
    }

    ...the functions the functions sapp_width(), sapp_height()
    and sapp_dpi_scale() will return the following values:

    sapp_width:     1280
    sapp_height:    960
    sapp_dpi_scale: 2.0

    If the high_dpi flag is false, or you're not running on a Retina display,
    the values would be:

    sapp_width:     640
    sapp_height:    480
    sapp_dpi_scale: 1.0

    If the window is moved from the Retina display to a low-dpi external display,
    the values would change as follows:

    sapp_width:     1280 => 640
    sapp_height:    960  => 480
    sapp_dpi_scale: 2.0  => 1.0

    Currently there is no event associated with a DPI change, but an
    SAPP_EVENTTYPE_RESIZED will be sent as a side effect of the
    framebuffer size changing.

    Per-monitor DPI is currently supported on macOS and Windows.

    APPLICATION QUIT
    ================
    Without special quit handling, a sokol_app.h application will quit
    'gracefully' when the user clicks the window close-button unless a
    platform's application model prevents this (e.g. on web or mobile).
    'Graceful exit' means that the application-provided cleanup callback will
    be called before the application quits.

    On native desktop platforms sokol_app.h provides more control over the
    application-quit-process. It's possible to initiate a 'programmatic quit'
    from the application code, and a quit initiated by the application user can
    be intercepted (for instance to show a custom dialog box).

    This 'programmatic quit protocol' is implemented through 3 functions
    and 1 event:

        - sapp_quit(): This function simply quits the application without
          giving the user a chance to intervene. Usually this might
          be called when the user clicks the 'Ok' button in a 'Really Quit?'
          dialog box
        - sapp_request_quit(): Calling sapp_request_quit() will send the
          event SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED to the applications event handler
          callback, giving the user code a chance to intervene and cancel the
          pending quit process (for instance to show a 'Really Quit?' dialog
          box). If the event handler callback does nothing, the application
          will be quit as usual. To prevent this, call the function
          sapp_cancel_quit() from inside the event handler.
        - sapp_cancel_quit(): Cancels a pending quit request, either initiated
          by the user clicking the window close button, or programmatically
          by calling sapp_request_quit(). The only place where calling this
          function makes sense is from inside the event handler callback when
          the SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED event has been received.
        - SAPP_EVENTTYPE_QUIT_REQUESTED: this event is sent when the user
          clicks the window's close button or application code calls the
          sapp_request_quit() function. The event handler callback code can handle
          this event by calling sapp_cancel_quit() to cancel the quit.
          If the event is ignored, the application will quit as usual.

    On the web platform, the quit behaviour differs from native platforms,
    because of web-specific restrictions:

    A `programmatic quit` initiated by calling sapp_quit() or
    sapp_request_quit() will work as described above: the cleanup callback is
    called, platform-specific cleanup is performed (on the web
    this means that JS event handlers are unregistered), and then
    the request-animation-loop will be exited. However that's all. The
    web page itself will continue to exist (e.g. it's not possible to
    programmatically close the browser tab).

    On the web it's also not possible to run custom code when the user
    closes a browser tab, so it's not possible to prevent this with a
    fancy custom dialog box.

    Instead the standard "Leave Site?" dialog box can be activated (or
    deactivated) with the following function:

        sapp_html5_ask_leave_site(bool ask);

    The initial state of the associated internal flag can be provided
    at startup via sapp_desc.html5.ask_leave_site.

    This feature should only be used sparingly in critical situations - for
    instance when the user would loose data - since popping up modal dialog
    boxes is considered quite rude in the web world. Note that there's no way
    to customize the content of this dialog box or run any code as a result
    of the user's decision. Also note that the user must have interacted with
    the site before the dialog box will appear. These are all security measures
    to prevent fishing.

    The Dear ImGui HighDPI sample contains example code of how to
    implement a 'Really Quit?' dialog box with Dear ImGui (native desktop
    platforms only), and for showing the hardwired "Leave Site?" dialog box
    when running on the web platform:

        https://floooh.github.io/sokol-html5/wasm/imgui-highdpi-sapp.html

    FULLSCREEN
    ==========
    If the sapp_desc.fullscreen flag is true, sokol-app will try to create
    a fullscreen window on platforms with a 'proper' window system
    (mobile devices will always use fullscreen). The implementation details
    depend on the target platform, in general sokol-app will use a
    'soft approach' which doesn't interfere too much with the platform's
    window system (for instance borderless fullscreen window instead of
    a 'real' fullscreen mode). Such details might change over time
    as sokol-app is adapted for different needs.

    The most important effect of fullscreen mode to keep in mind is that
    the requested canvas width and height will be ignored for the initial
    window size, calling sapp_width() and sapp_height() will instead return
    the resolution of the fullscreen canvas (however the provided size
    might still be used for the non-fullscreen window, in case the user can
    switch back from fullscreen- to windowed-mode).

    To toggle fullscreen mode programmatically, call sapp_toggle_fullscreen().

    To check if the application window is currently in fullscreen mode,
    call sapp_is_fullscreen().

    On the web, sapp_desc.fullscreen will have no effect, and the application
    will always start in non-fullscreen mode. Call sapp_toggle_fullscreen()
    from within or 'near' an input event to switch to fullscreen programatically.
    Note that on the web, the fullscreen state may change back to windowed at
    any time (either because the browser had rejected switching into fullscreen,
    or the user leaves fullscreen via Esc), this means that the result
    of sapp_is_fullscreen() may change also without calling sapp_toggle_fullscreen()!


    WINDOW ICON SUPPORT
    ===================
    Some sokol_app.h backends allow to change the window icon programmatically:

        - on Win32: the small icon in the window's title bar, and the
          bigger icon in the task bar
        - on Linux: highly dependent on the used window manager, but usually
          the window's title bar icon and/or the task bar icon
        - on HTML5: the favicon shown in the page's browser tab
        - on macOS: the application icon shown in the dock, but only
          for currently running applications

    NOTE that it is not possible to set the actual application icon which is
    displayed by the operating system on the desktop or 'home screen'. Those
    icons must be provided 'traditionally' through operating-system-specific
    resources which are associated with the application (sokol_app.h might
    later support setting the window icon from platform specific resource data
    though).

    There are two ways to set the window icon:

        - at application start in the sokol_main() function by initializing
          the sapp_desc.icon nested struct
        - or later by calling the function sapp_set_icon()

    As a convenient shortcut, sokol_app.h comes with a builtin default-icon
    (a rainbow-colored 'S', which at least looks a bit better than the Windows
    default icon for applications), which can be activated like this:

    At startup in sokol_main():

        sapp_desc sokol_main(...) {
            return (sapp_desc){
                ...
                icon.sokol_default = true
            };
        }

    Or later by calling:

        sapp_set_icon(&(sapp_icon_desc){ .sokol_default = true });

    NOTE that a completely zero-initialized sapp_icon_desc struct will not
    update the window icon in any way. This is an 'escape hatch' so that you
    can handle the window icon update yourself (or if you do this already,
    sokol_app.h won't get in your way, in this case just leave the
    sapp_desc.icon struct zero-initialized).

    Providing your own icon images works exactly like in GLFW (down to the
    data format):

    You provide one or more 'candidate images' in different sizes, and the
    sokol_app.h platform backends pick the best match for the specific backend
    and icon type.

    For each candidate image, you need to provide:

        - the width in pixels
        - the height in pixels
        - and the actual pixel data in RGBA8 pixel format (e.g. 0xFFCC8844
          on a little-endian CPU means: alpha=0xFF, blue=0xCC, green=0x88, red=0x44)

    For instance, if you have 3 candidate images (small, medium, big) of
    sizes 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 the corresponding sapp_icon_desc struct is setup
    like this:

        // the actual pixel data (RGBA8, origin top-left)
        const uint32_t small[16][16]  = { ... };
        const uint32_t medium[32][32] = { ... };
        const uint32_t big[64][64]    = { ... };

        const sapp_icon_desc icon_desc = {
            .images = {
                { .width = 16, .height = 16, .pixels = SAPP_RANGE(small) },
                { .width = 32, .height = 32, .pixels = SAPP_RANGE(medium) },
                // ...or without the SAPP_RANGE helper macro:
                { .width = 64, .height = 64, .pixels = { .ptr=big, .size=sizeof(big) } }
            }
        };

    An sapp_icon_desc struct initialized like this can then either be applied
    at application start in sokol_main:

        sapp_desc sokol_main(...) {
            return (sapp_desc){
                ...
                icon = icon_desc
            };
        }

    ...or later by calling sapp_set_icon():

        sapp_set_icon(&icon_desc);

    Some window icon caveats:

        - once the window icon has been updated, there's no way to go back to
          the platform's default icon, this is because some platforms (Linux
          and HTML5) don't switch the icon visual back to the default even if
          the custom icon is deleted or removed
        - on HTML5, if the sokol_app.h icon doesn't show up in the browser
          tab, check that there's no traditional favicon 'link' element
          is defined in the page's index.html, sokol_app.h will only
          append a new favicon link element, but not delete any manually
          defined favicon in the page

    For an example and test of the window icon feature, check out the
    'icon-sapp' sample on the sokol-samples git repository.

    ONSCREEN KEYBOARD
    =================
    On some platforms which don't provide a physical keyboard, sokol-app
    can display the platform's integrated onscreen keyboard for text
    input. To request that the onscreen keyboard is shown, call

        sapp_show_keyboard(true);

    Likewise, to hide the keyboard call:

        sapp_show_keyboard(false);

    Note that onscreen keyboard functionality is no longer supported
    on the browser platform (the previous hacks and workarounds to make browser
    keyboards work for on web applications that don't use HTML UIs
    never really worked across browsers).

    INPUT EVENT BUBBLING ON THE WEB PLATFORM
    ========================================
    By default, input event bubbling on the web platform is configured in
    a way that makes the most sense for 'full-canvas' apps that cover the
    entire browser client window area:

    - mouse, touch and wheel events do not bubble up, this prevents various
      ugly side events, like:
        - HTML text overlays being selected on double- or triple-click into
          the canvas
        - 'scroll bumping' even when the canvas covers the entire client area
    - key_up/down events for 'character keys' *do* bubble up (otherwise
      the browser will not generate UNICODE character events)
    - all other key events *do not* bubble up by default (this prevents side effects
      like F1 opening help, or F7 starting 'caret browsing')
    - character events do not bubble up (although I haven't noticed any side effects
      otherwise)

    Event bubbling can be enabled for input event categories during initialization
    in the sapp_desc struct:

        sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
            return (sapp_desc){
                //...
                .html5 = {
                    .bubble_mouse_events = true,
                    .bubble_touch_events = true,
                    .bubble_wheel_events = true,
                    .bubble_key_events = true,
                    .bubble_char_events = true,
                }
            };
        }

    This basically opens the floodgates and lets *all* input events bubble up to the browser.

    To prevent individual events from bubbling, call sapp_consume_event() from within
    the sokol_app.h event callback when that specific event is reported.


    SETTING THE CANVAS OBJECT ON THE WEB PLATFORM
    =============================================
    On the web, sokol_app.h and the Emscripten SDK functions need to find
    the WebGL/WebGPU canvas intended for rendering and attaching event
    handlers. This can happen in four ways:

    1. do nothing and just set the id of the canvas object to 'canvas' (preferred)
    2. via a CSS Selector string (preferred)
    3. by setting the `Module.canvas` property to the canvas object
    4. by adding the canvas object to the global variable `specialHTMLTargets[]`
       (this is a special variable used by the Emscripten runtime to lookup
       event target objects for which document.querySelector() cannot be used)

    The easiest way is to just name your canvas object 'canvas':

        <canvas id="canvas" ...></canvas>

    This works because the default css selector string used by sokol_app.h
    is '#canvas'.

    If you name your canvas differently, you need to communicate that name to
    sokol_app.h via `sapp_desc.html5.canvas_selector` as a regular css selector
    string that's compatible with `document.querySelector()`. E.g. if your canvas
    object looks like this:

        <canvas id="bla" ...></canvas>

    The `sapp_desc.html5.canvas_selector` string must be set to '#bla':

        .html5.canvas_selector = "#bla"

    If the canvas object cannot be looked up via `document.querySelector()` you
    need to use one of the alternative methods, both involve the special
    Emscripten runtime `Module` object which is usually setup in the index.html
    like this before the WASM blob is loaded and instantiated:

        <script type='text/javascript'>
            var Module = {
                // ...
            };
        </script>

    The first option is to set the `Module.canvas` property to your canvas object:

        <script type='text/javascript'>
            var Module = {
                canvas: my_canvas_object,
            };
        </script>

    When sokol_app.h initializes, it will check the global Module object whether
    a `Module.canvas` property exists and is an object. This method will add
    a new entry to the `specialHTMLTargets[]` object

    The other option is to add the canvas under a name chosen by you to the
    special `specialHTMLTargets[]` map, which is used by the Emscripten runtime
    to lookup 'event target objects' which are not visible to `document.querySelector()`.
    Note that `specialHTMLTargets[]` must be updated after the Emscripten runtime
    has started but before the WASM code is running. A good place for this is
    the special `Module.preRun` array in index.html:

        <script type='text/javascript'>
            var Module = {
                preRun: [
                    () => {
                        specialHTMLTargets['my_canvas'] = my_canvas_object;
                    }
                ],
            };
        </script>

    In that case, pass the same string to sokol_app.h which is used as key
    in the specialHTMLTargets[] map:

        .html5.canvas_selector = "my_canvas"

    If sokol_app.h can't find your canvas for some reason check for warning
    messages on the browser console.


    OPTIONAL: DON'T HIJACK main() (#define SOKOL_NO_ENTRY)
    ======================================================
    NOTE: SOKOL_NO_ENTRY and sapp_run() is currently not supported on Android.

    In its default configuration, sokol_app.h "hijacks" the platform's
    standard main() function. This was done because different platforms
    have different entry point conventions which are not compatible with
    C's main() (for instance WinMain on Windows has completely different
    arguments). However, this "main hijacking" posed a problem for
    usage scenarios like integrating sokol_app.h with other languages than
    C or C++, so an alternative SOKOL_NO_ENTRY mode has been added
    in which the user code provides the platform's main function:

    - define SOKOL_NO_ENTRY before including the sokol_app.h implementation
    - do *not* provide a sokol_main() function
    - instead provide the standard main() function of the platform
    - from the main function, call the function ```sapp_run()``` which
      takes a pointer to an ```sapp_desc``` structure.
    - from here on```sapp_run()``` takes over control and calls the provided
      init-, frame-, event- and cleanup-callbacks just like in the default model.

    sapp_run() behaves differently across platforms:

        - on some platforms, sapp_run() will return when the application quits
        - on other platforms, sapp_run() will never return, even when the
          application quits (the operating system is free to simply terminate
          the application at any time)
        - on Emscripten specifically, sapp_run() will return immediately while
          the frame callback keeps being called

    This different behaviour of sapp_run() essentially means that there shouldn't
    be any code *after* sapp_run(), because that may either never be called, or in
    case of Emscripten will be called at an unexpected time (at application start).

    An application also should not depend on the cleanup-callback being called
    when cross-platform compatibility is required.

    Since sapp_run() returns immediately on Emscripten you shouldn't activate
    the 'EXIT_RUNTIME' linker option (this is disabled by default when compiling
    for the browser target), since the C/C++ exit runtime would be called immediately at
    application start, causing any global objects to be destroyed and global
    variables to be zeroed.

    WINDOWS CONSOLE OUTPUT
    ======================
    On Windows, regular windowed applications don't show any stdout/stderr text
    output, which can be a bit of a hassle for printf() debugging or generally
    logging text to the console. Also, console output by default uses a local
    codepage setting and thus international UTF-8 encoded text is printed
    as garbage.

    To help with these issues, sokol_app.h can be configured at startup
    via the following Windows-specific sapp_desc flags:

        sapp_desc.win32.console_utf8 (default: false)
            When set to true, the output console codepage will be switched
            to UTF-8 (and restored to the original codepage on exit)

        sapp_desc.win32.console_attach (default: false)
            When set to true, stdout and stderr will be attached to the
            console of the parent process (if the parent process actually
            has a console). This means that if the application was started
            in a command line window, stdout and stderr output will be printed
            to the terminal, just like a regular command line program. But if
            the application is started via double-click, it will behave like
            a regular UI application, and stdout/stderr will not be visible.

        sapp_desc.win32.console_create (default: false)
            When set to true, a new console window will be created and
            stdout/stderr will be redirected to that console window. It
            doesn't matter if the application is started from the command
            line or via double-click.

            NOTE: setting both win32.console_attach and win32.console_create
            to true also makes sense and has the effect that output
            will appear in the existing terminal when started from the cmdline, and
            otherwise (when started via double-click) will open a console window.

    MEMORY ALLOCATION OVERRIDE
    ==========================
    You can override the memory allocation functions at initialization time
    like this:

        void* my_alloc(size_t size, void* user_data) {
            return malloc(size);
        }

        void my_free(void* ptr, void* user_data) {
            free(ptr);
        }

        sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
            return (sapp_desc){
                // ...
                .allocator = {
                    .alloc_fn = my_alloc,
                    .free_fn = my_free,
                    .user_data = ...,
                }
            };
        }

    If no overrides are provided, malloc and free will be used.

    This only affects memory allocation calls done by sokol_app.h
    itself though, not any allocations in OS libraries.


    ERROR REPORTING AND LOGGING
    ===========================
    To get any logging information at all you need to provide a logging callback in the setup call
    the easiest way is to use sokol_log.h:

        #include "sokol_log.h"

        sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                ...
                .logger.func = slog_func,
            };
        }

    To override logging with your own callback, first write a logging function like this:

        void my_log(const char* tag,                // e.g. 'sapp'
                    uint32_t log_level,             // 0=panic, 1=error, 2=warn, 3=info
                    uint32_t log_item_id,           // SAPP_LOGITEM_*
                    const char* message_or_null,    // a message string, may be nullptr in release mode
                    uint32_t line_nr,               // line number in sokol_app.h
                    const char* filename_or_null,   // source filename, may be nullptr in release mode
                    void* user_data)
        {
            ...
        }

    ...and then setup sokol-app like this:

        sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
            return (sapp_desc) {
                ...
                .logger = {
                    .func = my_log,
                    .user_data = my_user_data,
                }
            };
        }

    The provided logging function must be reentrant (e.g. be callable from
    different threads).

    If you don't want to provide your own custom logger it is highly recommended to use
    the standard logger in sokol_log.h instead, otherwise you won't see any warnings or
    errors.

    TEMP NOTE DUMP
    ==============
    - sapp_desc needs a bool whether to initialize depth-stencil surface
    - the Android implementation calls cleanup_cb() and destroys the egl context in onDestroy
      at the latest but should do it earlier, in onStop, as an app is "killable" after onStop
      on Android Honeycomb and later (it can't be done at the moment as the app may be started
      again after onStop and the sokol lifecycle does not yet handle context teardown/bringup)

/*== iOS (Metal) ============================================================
    Implements the public sokol_app.h API on iOS plus the multi-window API
    (as stubs -- there is exactly ONE UIWindow bound to the connecting
    UIWindowScene, so a second window is not representable;
    sapp_create_window() returns the invalid handle and logs).

    UIKit owns the loop: sapp_run() -> UIApplicationMain() never returns.
    The real setup (UIWindow + CAMetalLayer + CADisplayLink) happens later,
    scene-driven, inside scene:willConnectToSession: -- the scene lifecycle
    is adopted PROGRAMMATICALLY via the app delegate's
    configurationForConnectingSceneSession: (the TrussC Info-iOS.plist has
    NO UIApplicationSceneManifest; that method is what makes scenes work).
    The frame driver is the CADisplayLink firing displayLinkFired: every
    vsync; backgrounding pauses the link (rendering while suspended is an
    iOS watchdog kill) and fires SAPP_EVENTTYPE_SUSPENDED/RESUMED.

    Structure mirrors sokol_app.h's iOS backend including all TrussC
    patches: runtime orientation control (_sapp_tc_ios_view_ctrl +
    sapp_ios_set_supported_orientations), immersive mode (the NON-STATIC
    global _sapp_ios_immersive_mode -- tcPlatform_ios.mm externs it by
    name, keep it), view-bounds dimension update, drawable-size readback
    after resize (sapp_width/height must match what Metal actually
    renders), RGB10A2 10-bit layer + MSAA format, framebufferOnly=false
    for captureWindow() readback, and sapp_ios_get_window() for the
    document picker. Input is multi-touch plus an on-screen keyboard
    driven through a hidden UITextField (CHAR + Enter/Space/Backspace
    only). Upstream's GLES3/EAGL path is not ported -- TrussC iOS is
    Metal-only. The tvOS press-event code is lifted but unexercised. */

/*== Linux (X11 + GLX, desktop GL core) =====================================
    Implements the public sokol_app.h API on Linux plus the multi-window API.
    Structure mirrors sokol_app.h's X11/GLX backend (quit dance on
    WM_DELETE_WINDOW, per-frame size polling instead of ConfigureNotify, XKB
    physical-key-name keytable + XkbSetDetectableAutoRepeat software repeat,
    XLookupString + keysym table CHAR events, CLIPBOARD selection, XDND v5,
    EWMH fullscreen, Xcursor cursors, TrussC skip_present patch).

    Frame pacing: ONE GLXContext is shared by all windows, each window has its
    own GLXWindow drawable. The MAIN window keeps upstream's model: the run
    loop blocks inside its vsync'd glXSwapBuffers (swap interval 1 via
    GLX_EXT_swap_control on its drawable) -- that blocking swap IS the pacing.
    SECONDARY windows swap with interval 0 (never block; vsyncing two or more
    drawables would serialize the loop to refresh/N) and are timer-paced to a
    refresh-period estimate measured from the main window's presents. If the
    main swap stops blocking (iconified, skip_present, no usable swap-control
    extension), the tick self-heals to timer pacing, so the loop can never
    busy-spin.

    Unlike upstream, GLX entry points are called directly (TrussC's Linux
    build always links libGL for sokol_gfx's GLCORE backend, so the dlopen
    dance is unnecessary); only extension functions go through
    glXGetProcAddressARB. */

    single-window; sapp_create_window() returns the invalid handle and logs).

    Unlike the GLCORE branch above (a from-scratch multi-window X11+GLX

    single-window X11 backend with the EGL context path (SOKOL_GLES3 ->
    _SAPP_EGL), the same way the web/iOS/Android sections were ported: the
    whole upstream body renamed _sapp_tc_*, with upstream member names kept
    in the state struct so the lifted code reads unchanged. The GLX forks
    inside the lifted code are dead (_SAPP_GLX undefined). TrussC patches
    ride along: skip_present, RGB10A2 is NOT used here (GLES3 swapchain is
    RGBA8, same as upstream). Clipboard, XDND drag&drop, Xcursor cursors,
    XKB keytable and EWMH fullscreen are all live upstream features. */

/*== Android (GLES3 / NativeActivity) =======================================
    Implements the public sokol_app.h API on Android plus the multi-window
    API (as stubs -- the activity owns exactly ONE ANativeWindow, so a
    second window is not representable; sapp_create_window() returns the
    invalid handle and logs).

    The entry point is INVERTED relative to every other platform: this
    section EXPORTS ANativeActivity_onCreate() (NativeActivity dlopens the
    app .so and calls it on Android's UI thread), which spawns a dedicated
    APP THREAD and returns. The app thread owns the ALooper, the EGL
    display/context/surface, the frame loop and every TrussC callback
    (init/frame/event/cleanup); the UI thread only forwards lifecycle
    callbacks through a message pipe + mutex/cond handshake. sapp_run()
    is NOT supported (SOKOL_NO_ENTRY is a compile error); sokol_main()
    is defined by TrussC's platform/android/sokol_impl.cpp bridge.

    The EGL surface has an independent lifecycle: it is destroyed on
    background and recreated on foreground (APP_CMD state machine); frames
    only run while has_resumed && has_focus && a surface exists.

    Structure mirrors sokol_app.h's Android backend including all TrussC
    patches: the Choreographer vsync-paced frame loop with ALooper poll
    fallback (compiled in at __ANDROID_API__ >= 29), the BACK-key
    no-shutdown fix (kiosk/screen-pinning survival -- BACK is consumed,
    never tears down EGL), DPI scale from AConfiguration_getDensity()/160
    with fb/win-ratio fallback, and the skip_present early-return. Input
    is multi-touch + the BACK key; orientation and immersive mode are
    TrussC-side JNI (tcPlatform_android.cpp), not sokol's business. */

/*== Emscripten (web) =======================================================
    Implements the public sokol_app.h API on the web plus the multi-window
    API (as stubs -- the whole backend binds to ONE <canvas> element, so a
    second window is not representable; sapp_create_window() returns the
    invalid handle and logs).

    Unlike every native backend there is NO owned loop: sapp_run() sets
    everything up, hands a per-frame callback to
    emscripten_request_animation_frame_loop() (or emscripten_set_main_loop())
    and RETURNS IMMEDIATELY. Rendering, events and the quit dance all happen
    later inside browser-driven callbacks; "quit" stops the rAF loop and
    tears down sokol state -- the tab and the wasm module stay alive.

    Structure mirrors sokol_app.h's emscripten backend (HTML5 event
    callbacks on the canvas selector, code-string keymap, deferred
    pointer-lock on user gesture, execCommand copy + paste-event clipboard,
    dragndrop with FileReader fetch, CSS cursors + BMP-in-JS custom cursors,
    favicon icon, resize tracking via CSS size x devicePixelRatio). Both
    graphics backends are supported: SOKOL_WGPU (async adapter/device chain
    gated by init_done, browser auto-presents the surface at rAF boundaries)
    and SOKOL_GLES3 (WebGL2 context, swapchain = default framebuffer).

    The TrussC keyboard-on-canvas patch is native here: key handlers are
    registered on the canvas selector (NOT the window), so other page
    elements (e.g. an editor besides the canvas) receive keyboard input
    independently. The canvas element needs a tabindex attribute and focus
    for keyboard events to arrive (the TrussC web shell provides both). */
