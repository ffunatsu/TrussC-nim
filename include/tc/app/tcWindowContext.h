// =============================================================================
//
// Multi-window support: every piece of state that is conceptually "per window"
// — input, hover/scene, camera/projection, render-pass, per-window frame count,
// lighting/material/environment, and the per-frame shadow-slot assignment —
// lives in one WindowContext instead of scattered process globals.
// currentWindowContext() == mainWindowContext() while only the main window is
// running; each secondary native window owns its own context and the native
// layer switches internal::currentWindowCtx() while dispatching that window's
// events and draw (see tcWindow.h / platform/*/tcWindow*).
//
// This file is included from TrussC.h AFTER tcRenderTarget.h (RenderTarget by
// value) and tcCameraContext.h / tcCoreEvents.h; it is not self-contained. It
// is included BEFORE the 3D headers (tcLight/tcMaterial/tcEnvironment), so the
// lighting members below are held by forward-declared pointer / pointer-vector.
//
// Hot-reload note: mainWindowContext() is NON-inline (defined in tcGlobal.cpp)
// so Host and Guest share one instance — same pattern as events() and
// getDefaultContext(). The RenderContext / CoreEvents pointers below are wired
// lazily by those accessors, preserving their existing construction timing.
